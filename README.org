* Mourning-Grounds 

Pre-config:
- clone https://github.com/dkochmanski/slime/ into your local quicklisp projects or common-lisp folder, it has modifications to get it to work with the browser
- install the websocket package from MELPA if you don't have it
- Add .emacs to your .emacs

** Usage
Open up a lisp file in the project and press C-M L, it will show T when the lime server is up and nil when it's down.

sbcl --load webserver.lisp

Navigate to localhost:8888/slug.html

Press the connect button to connect to your emacs session. You should get a normal slime window.
Company-mode repeatedly throws harmless but annoying errors, I recommend only turning it on for a short while as needed.
